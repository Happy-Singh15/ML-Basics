 # Discretization

 Discretization is the process of transforming continuous variables into discrete variables by creating a set of contiguous intervals that span the range of the variable's values. Discretization is also known as Binning, where bin is alternative name for interval.

 # Why use Discretization 

 1. To handle Outliers
 2. To improve the value spread

 # Types of Discretization

 1. Unsupervised 
    - Equal Width (Uniform Binning)
    - Equal Frequency (Quantile Binning)
    - K-means Binning

2. Supervised  
    - Decision Tree Binning

3. Custom Binning
